         <p>Through careful manipulation of time travel, your last memory becomes the only destination to travel back too. This starts to give you relief, to go back in time and stop yourself from opening the box, thus preventing being stuck in the seventh dimension. You cast yourself to that night in the fog, and thus you see yourself in the distance. You begin to run towards yourself in haste in order to prevent yourself from opening the box. When you finally come face to face with yourself, you feel something puncture your ribcage, stopping you in your place. You keel over. Cold. <h2>The End</h2>
