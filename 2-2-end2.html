         <p>You stab the figure in the chest, hopefully hitting the unknown human's heart. In a defensive stance, you begin to asses the situation, no longer controlled by pure adrenaline. The figure is wearing a black hoodie, the same black hoodie you have on. You take the hoodie off their head, revealing your own face. You stabbed yourself. You are dead. But yet, you are alive. 
          <p>In a confused state you begin to tremble until you pass out from shock. You awake a few hours later. You awake with no memory of the previous events. Completely blank. </p>
          <p>You awake at the beginning of the rest of your life.</p>
